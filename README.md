# GRRBAC-Verifier

Welcome to the repository of the GR-RBAC Policy Verifier! 

The policy verifier is a prototype created to support and test the ideas from my master thesis at [Nedap](https://www.nedapsecurity.com/). In the thesis, we explored how realistic evolving physical access control systems can be incrementally verified. The thesis can be found here: XXX. The implementation is discussed in Chapter 7. For demonstration purposes, we also developed a CLI version of the policy verfier. Next to the source code of our prototype, this repository also contains the anonymized access control policy and the test cases we used during the evaluation of the prototype. 

If this projects spraks your interest, don't hesitate to send me a message :)
