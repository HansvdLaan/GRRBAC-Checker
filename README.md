# GRRBAC-Verifier
======
Welcome to the repository of the GR-RBAC Policy Verifier! 

The policy verifier is a prototype created to support and test the ideas from my master thesis. In the thesis, we explored how realistic evolving physical access control systems could be incrementally verified. The thesis can be found here: XXX. The implementation is discussed in Chapter 7. This repository also contains the anonymized access control policy and the test cases we used during the evaluation of the prototype.
